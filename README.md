# Datasets:

- [Visual Cortex](https://crcns.org/data-sets/vc/pvc-1):
  - Potential Usecases: For curing blindness, visualizing dreams & memories, augmenting vision, and recording/streaming using the human eye. When coupled with the amygdala, this would allow a person to see another's face and feel the experience of love upon gazing at their countenance. This would be a useful application for people with alzheimer's dementia or those in couple's therapy to experience the bonding connection they once had when looking into each other's eyes.
- [Auditory Cortex](https://crcns.org/data-sets/ac):
  - Potential Usecases: For curing deafness, enabling high-quality audio signals at live events, augmenting hearing to enable hearing frequencies outside the normal range of human hearing. Enabling instructions for clandestine operations or domestic phone calls.
- [Motor Cortex](https://crcns.org/data-sets/motor-cortex):
  - Potential Usecases: Predicting movement future movements to understand a Person's intent. Could be used to pre-empt or detect undesired activity such as spasms or violent crime. Could also enable super-human prolonged periods of strength and endurance when applied to feats of strength competitions and running distances.
- [Somatosensory Cortex](https://crcns.org/data-sets/ssc):
  - Potential Usecases: Useful for developing the sensation of touch to allow a person to feel. If a peripheral device was developed, signals from the hands could be sent to the somatosensory cortex to enable people to experience holding hands or cooking or running their hands through a person's hair or performing useful work. This would greatly increase the quality of human life and increase the workforce.
